# Warp Rules - Development Workflow

## Development Process Guidelines

1. **First think through the problem**, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to `tasks/todo.md`.

2. **The plan should have a list of todo items** that you can check off as you complete them

3. **Before you begin working**, check in with me and I will verify the plan.

4. **Then, begin working on the todo items**, marking them as complete as you go.

5. **Please every step of the way** just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made

6. **Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible**. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.

7. **Finally, add a review section** to the `todo.md` file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.

## Key Principles

- ✅ **Simplicity First**: Every change should be minimal and focused
- ✅ **Plan Before Code**: Always create a todo list before starting work
- ✅ **Check-in Process**: Verify the plan before beginning implementation
- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Mark items complete as you go
- ✅ **Documentation**: Provide high-level explanations for each change
- ✅ **Review Process**: Summarize all changes at the end

## File Structure

- `tasks/todo.md` - Contains the current project todo list and review section
- `warprules.md` - This file containing the development workflow rules

---
*These rules ensure consistent, manageable, and well-documented development progress.*
